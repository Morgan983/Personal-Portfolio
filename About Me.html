  <h2>Family</h2>
  <p>I am a born and bred native of Columbus, Ohio with family ties linking to Central Appalachia and Gullah Geechee descendants in South Carolina. I am the youngest of two older brothers, so I'm simultaneously the spoiled one and the keeper of secrets.</p>
  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>I attended Gahanna Public Schools from K-12 and then completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology with a minor in Studio Art from Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Social Work with an emphasis in Public Affairs from The Ohio State University.</p>
  <h2>How did I get into coding?</h2>
  <p>Besides the fact that I often refer to myself as a house cat personified, I also think of myself as an incrediby left-brained scientist. I never was a traditional learner and for many years navigated the public school system with undiagnosed ADHD (how fun).</p>
  <P>I've always naturally gravitated towards arts and literature, and still do, but I was also fascinated by the world of computers. In 10th grade, I had to take a mandatory computer ed class and discovered how enthralling it was to build and design a website of my own.</P>
  <p>Unfortunately, the powers that be, AKA the ACT, determined that I would not be entering any STEM studies in university (or so the negative voice told me in my head). So I majored in psychology because I love that too and mixed some art in too. With my master's my heart is still directed towards helping others, but computer science is still a calling that I wish to fulfill.</p>
  <P>Long story short: after a chaotic move to the East Coast and moving back during the pandemic, I stumbled across G{Code} and took the opportunity to indulge in some intellectual self-care and really pour love into that part of me that wanted to explore web development and cybersecurity!</P>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I love all things nature, hikes, walks and picnicking with loved ones. I also love listening to music -- any genre, read, mostly autobiographies, fantasy and psychological thrillers. And lastly, art, no matter the medium, has my whole heart.</p>
